Predicting Rookies
==================

This is the repository for a simple predictive model of NFL performance, by way of Fantasy Football points, during a player's rookie season using data freely available online. It can also be used as a starting point to creating a comprehensive NCAA -> NFL transition analysis.

This project creates a predictive model for rookie season fantasy performance based on a player's NCAA career statistics, NFL Combine measurables, and NFL Draft pick.

You must also have Python 2.7, iPython Notebook, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Sci-Kit Learn installed. These dependencies should be installed using pip or easy_install.
