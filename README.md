Predicting Rookies
==================

This is the repository for a predictive model of rookie season NFL performance. The project uses only data freely available online and can be used to predict how well upcoming rookies will perform in the context of fantasy football. 

It can also be used as a starting point to creating a comprehensive NCAA to NFL transition analysis. Data used in model includes NCAA career statistics, NFL Combine measurables, NFL Draft pick, and NFL Fantasy and real Football statistics for the years 2005 and later as that is when NCAA data becomes available.
